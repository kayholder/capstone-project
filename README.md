### ABOUT

This capstone project is a website for an online bookclub. The purpose of this website is to draw people in who have similar interests and to create a community who can read together and laugh together. There is a sign up section for those who want to get involved and it also includes a section of books we are currently reading and books we have read in the past. At the bottom of the page you will notice a quote, and this quote is to pull from certain books. I used html, css, and javascript in order to complete this project.

### Requirements Met

The requirements me in this project was the use of 
- Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
- Create a form and store the submitted values using an external API (e.g. a contact form, survey, etc).
- Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.

I know I was only supposed to have three total, but since I had some extra time on my hands I decided to challenge myself and create a form that could store and submit values. 

### How to View Stored Data
- In order to view the stored data connected to the form. I used a website called [pantry.io ](https://getpantry.cloud/#)
- You may view what was entered by clicking on dashboard and using the key ed5e1e39-f6eb-4084-a640-4c9f4ac4ffde (you can also see this key in my app.js)
- However, you will only be able to see the stored data AFTER you have submitted the information being asked for on the form.

### Checking Methods
- I checked if my website works in mobile view by playing with the size of my screen through inspect. I also have a mac and a windows so I was able to check my site on both devices. 
- Others assisted by also viewing the website on their device to see how it would look on their end.
- I checked my project by right clicking index.html and clicking on "live server" this extension was crucial in helping me check my website continuously. It gave instant live feedback on my project. 
- In order to see if my pantry key/code worked like it should. I went into inspect and clicked "network" and there it would give me a 400 error code or it would give me a 200 code if it processed.
